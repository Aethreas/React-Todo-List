## Focus
This project was done to learn the basic synax of React.js and test components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### What I learned:

Workflow for installing React and Express through NPM in powershell.

Use of components in React to create webpages out of building blocks that can easily integrate with JavaScript.

Basics of Express.js for routing to simple webpages in conjunction with React rendering.
